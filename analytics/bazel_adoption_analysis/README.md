## Bazel Adoption Analysis

A little while ago I manually investigated how well Bazel was becoming adopted by software companies.
One of the things I found was that it appears Bazel is used in 5 of the top 10 YCombinator companies, and only 9 of those top 10 'do software'.

This part of the codebase includes an attempt to programmatically answer the following kinds of questions: 

- How many of the world's largest software companies are adopting Bazel?
- How many of the world's unicorns are adopting Bazel? 
- How many of the F500 are adopting Bazel?
- How fast is Bazel usage growing on Github?
